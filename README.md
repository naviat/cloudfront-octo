This Terraform configuration defines an AWS CloudFront distribution for multiple EKS clusters specified in a variable called var.eks_clusters. Here's what each part of the code does:

## 1. Provider Configuration:
  - Specifies that AWS is the cloud provider.
  - Sets the AWS region to us-west-2 where the resources will be provisioned.

## 2. Resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution":
  - Defines a CloudFront distribution for each entry in the `var.eks_clusters` map, which presumably contains information about different EKS clusters.
  - `for_each` is used to create a distribution for each EKS cluster defined in the `var.eks_clusters`.

## 3. Origin Configuration:
  - Sets the domain name and origin ID for the CloudFront distribution based on values from `each.value.domain_name` and `each.key` respectively. Here, `each.key` might represent a unique identifier for each cluster.

## 4. Distribution Settings:
  - Enables the distribution and IPv6 support.
  - Defines the default cache behavior, allowing various HTTP methods and specifying which methods should be cached (`GET` and `HEAD`).
  - Sets up the policy for forwarding requests to the origin, including not forwarding query strings and not forwarding cookies.

## 5. Viewer Protocol Policy:
  - Enforces HTTPS by redirecting all HTTP requests to HTTPS.

## 6. Restrictions:
  - Applies geographic restrictions to limit access to the distribution. It uses a whitelist approach where only specified locations (defined in `each.value.locations`) are allowed to access the distribution.

## 7. Viewer Certificate:
  - Uses the default CloudFront SSL/TLS certificate to serve content over HTTPS.

Overall, this code configures a series of CloudFront distributions tailored to multiple EKS clusters, each with specific caching rules, security settings, and access restrictions based on geographic location.
